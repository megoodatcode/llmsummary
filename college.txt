Read the following essay. Then, check for the following elements.

Can you create a detailed description about how well this essay is written. 
When reading this essay, keep in mind these key elements:
1. Inasmuch as essays should have a creative build, they must have boundaries that mitigate harmful, biased and/or explicit language. 
For this, check for these following wording:
   * Insensitive language: this includes any wording that insults others - whether it was intended or not. For example, some old-fashioned phrases like 'red indian' are considered offensive. Are any of these phrases showing a form of racism, ageism, ableism, or sexism? If so, make a JSON object(or add to one if one is already created[and do not return this(yet!)]) with a list:
      * 'insensitive language' containing a dictionary for each phrase, with three key/value pairs each - 
         1. 'sentence' key with value of the sentence with the offensive language
         2. 'phrase' key with value of the offensive phrase/wording
         3. 'reason' key with value of the reason for this phrase being flagged
   In addition, check for Individuality
   * This means checking for wording that reduces a large population group to their common traits; Does it seem like any phrases make it seem like the essay points to any groups, and single them out without context? Does it draw from any stereotypes - e.g. All asians are nerds because they are Asian? If so, make a JSON object(or add to one if one is already created[and do not return this(yet!)]) with a list:
      * 'Individuality and generalizing' containing a dictionary for each offending phrase, with three key/value pairs each - 
         1. 'sentence' key with value of the sentence with the offensive language
         2. 'phrase' key with value of the offensive phrase/wording
         3. 'reason' key with value of the reason for this phrase being flagged
Furthermore, look for good(and could-be-improved) writing, and rate each item(of the ordered list) on a scale of zero to ten, adding(or making) a JSON object, with the key being a the list item(without the colon), and a sentence(that begins with the rating[like '1']) followed by a '-', and the reason for the rating.  
1. The hook:
   * The hook includes, at most, the first two sentences. It is designed to engage readers, so they will continue to read on.
   * When reading this, ask yourself: Does this essay encompass a good opening? Loosely, it should follow one of four ways: a rhetorical question(a question to involve the readers/ put them in your shoes), a simile/metaphor(to help connect readers to the author's position), a scene(imagery that 'paints'/describes the author's life), or an anecdote(a personal story, which should differ from the main essay point or make the reader interested in that story)?
   * when grading the hook, grade using the scales with descriptions:
      **zero -(completely full of offensive language, explicit content, and/or has a flat tone, like having no emotions or descriptions to describe how the essay's author feels )
