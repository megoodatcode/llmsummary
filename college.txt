To pull text from a .txt file in Python, you can use the built-in open() function along with methods like read(), readline(), or readlines(). Here’s a simple example to get you started:

Open the file: Use the open() function to open the file.
Read the content: Use one of the reading methods.
Close the file: Always close the file after you’re done.
Here’s a basic example:

Python

# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the entire content of the file
    content = file.read()

# Print the content
print(content)

Explanation:
open('example.txt', 'r'): Opens the file in read mode.
file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file.
with statement: Ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
If you want to read the file line by line, you can use readlines():

Python

# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read all lines into a list
    lines = file.readlines()

# Print each line
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())  # strip() removes the newline character

This method is useful if you need to process each line individually.
