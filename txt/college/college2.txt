After thinking about each part of the essay, think about the overall story. The underlying questions should be:
Does it make sense? Is there a smooth transition from one paragraph to another? Does the story itself focus on the right things?\n

Check for all of the following elements(answer them with as much constructive critism as possible)-> 
* A narrative that describes the author and their background
* Details that include the author's motivation, daily life, major accomplishments
* author's character / values
* reasons(but not explictly said) on how the author stands out from the other 50,000 applicants.
* the essay should reasonate with your feelings - there should be a journey that the author walks upon, 
    and strength by actions and initiations.
* Most of all, the essay MUST describe the author, so that admission officers can know you(as much as possible) better in 600 words or less.\n

Finally, return the JSON object, and a paragraph on your thoughts(include your answers to the questions on the overall essay[and any questions from the prompt]) 
about the overall story. It should include a claim about the essay's overall organization and outline, a few sentences defending your answer, and a quick conclusion.
