Create a detailed description about how well this essay is written. 
When reading this essay, keep in mind these key elements:
1. Inasmuch as essays should have a creative build, they must have boundaries that mitigate harmful, biased and/or explicit language. 
For this, check for these following wording:
   * Insensitive language: this includes any wording that insults others - whether it was intended or not. For example, some old-fashioned phrases like 'red indian' are considered offensive. Are any of these phrases showing a form of racism, ageism, ableism, or sexism? If so, make a JSON object(or add to one if one is already created[and do not return this(yet!)]) with a list:
      * 'insensitive language' containing a dictionary for each phrase, with three key/value pairs each - 
         1. 'sentence' key with value of the sentence with the offensive language
         2. 'phrase' key with value of the offensive phrase/wording
         3. 'reason' key with value of the reason for this phrase being flagged
   In addition, check for Individuality
   * This means checking for wording that reduces a large population group to their common traits; Does it seem like any phrases make it seem like the essay points to any groups, and single them out without context? Does it draw from any stereotypes - e.g. All asians are nerds because they are Asian? If so, make a JSON object(or add to one if one is already created[and do not return this(yet!)]) with a list:
      * 'Individuality and generalizing' containing a dictionary for each offending phrase, with three key/value pairs each - 
         1. 'sentence' key with value of the sentence with the offensive language
         2. 'phrase' key with value of the offensive phrase/wording
         3. 'reason' key with value of the reason for this phrase being flagged
Furthermore, look for good(and could-be-improved) writing, and rate each item(of the ordered list) on a scale of zero to ten, adding(or making) a JSON object, with the key being a the list item(without the colon), and a sentence(that begins with the rating[like '1']) followed by a '-', and the reason for the rating. Each bulleted item should affect the scale.
1. The hook:
   * The hook includes, at most, the first two sentences. It is designed to engage readers, so they will continue to read on.
   * The opening should not include a description of what the essay is about.
   * When reading this, ask yourself: Does this essay encompass a good opening? Loosely, it should follow one of four ways: a rhetorical question(a question to involve the readers/ put them in your shoes), a simile/metaphor(to help connect readers to the author's position), a scene(imagery that 'paints'/describes the author's life), or an anecdote(a personal story, which should differ from the main essay point or make the reader interested in that story).
   * If the hook does not follow those four ways, that's ok! First, check for the overused hooks: quotes by famous people, generic statements about major sources(e.g. 'computers have existed for such a short time'), or talk of old memories.
   * For all hooks, check for emotions[by looking for adjectives grade those on how conciseness and illistrative they are(could they be shortened, with about the same amount of emotion?)], 
   * when grading the hook, grade based off of the [0 to 10]scales with descriptions:
      **zero: the following descriptions are able to express the hook -> completely full of offensive language, explicit content, and has a flat tone, like having no emotions or descriptions to describe how the essay's author feels
      **ten: above and beyond these following requirements -> the hook is about only ONE specific incident, filled with adjectives that fully but concisely(less words is always better as long is it does not sacrifice writing substance) describes a story(but does not tell feelings outright), and follows/creates the same underlying tone(is there a sad/ i-am-the-underdog / grateful / etc. voice?) throughout the whole story. 
2. The description:
   * After the hook comes the description - what did the hook mean? The essay should about one or two sentences to explain what the hook meant and/or answer the hook's question. It is acceptable for the description to be part of the hook
   * grading this should be on the scale of zero to ten:
      ** a 'zero' grade means: the author wrote a different topic than that originally suggested by the hook, added words that did not add any value(the description paraphrased[at least partly] the hook), and/or revealed the rest of the story(very blatantly)
      ** a 'ten' grade means: going above and beyond the following requirements -> the author added to the hook(meaning, there was more information about the author's life than before or clears up/answers some questions the reader has), did not stray far from the hook's theme and experience, and talked more about their story than their hopes to join their college.
return the JSON object, and a paragraph or two on how well the introduction was written
